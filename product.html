            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><strong>Nowadays, it could be quite challenging to always cook healthy food. We cannot over-emphasize its importance.  However, with the ongoing pandemic situation, we can’t deny the fact that sometimes it could be quite tough to always prepare healthy meals. Of course, our number one concern is the budget. Many people are experiencing difficulty since work has been disrupted, and therefore less income is gained. Unless you grow your food yourself, it is but necessary to think of ways to stretch your dollar even for food. 
</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>But then, healthy food need not always be expensive. One can find ways to always create or prepare a dish of healthy food whether on a budget or not. In fact, it might be a good practice to always keep a budget for your food spending whether you got more or less money to do it with. This way, you could also be avoiding wastage either directly on food or money.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>So how do we deal with this difficulty of preparing healthy food on a budget? Well, when we speak of budget or budgeting, the most practical way of dealing with it is by planning. So, it follows if you are following a certain budget for your food or meals then you should plan your meal carefully. A well-planned meal is your best bet to make sure you put your dollar where it needs to go. And this is no secret. Every good homemaker will not tell you otherwise. A well-planned meal can give a lot of advantages as well, not just on the budgeting side of it but also on the managing side of it. 
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Having a meal plan allows you to make a targeted grocery list. This means that you can almost always guarantee that you get what’s necessary and not spend on random things. If you got a meal plan you can always prepare your ingredients ahead whenever it allows. This way, you can minimize the time spent on preparing than on cooking whenever its time to cook your meal. 
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Another big consideration in preparing a healthy is the state of the ingredients. Again, we cannot over-emphasize the importance of using fresh whole ingredients over frozen, much less, canned ones. But considering the difficulties of making fresh, whole food sources available in this pandemic situation we can use frozen or canned foods and still manage to prepare a healthy meal. So, if fresh, whole ingredients are not available and if worse, even frozen ones are a challenge to find, you may still use canned food. But at least choose the less processed ones. Canned food may not be as bad as we think, anyway. Canned foods are often thought to be less nutritious than fresh or frozen foods, but research shows that this is not always true. In fact, canning preserves most of the food's nutrients. Protein, carbs, and fat are unaffected by the process.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Inexpensive and convenient, canned food often gets panned for its high sodium content (which is true), but there are healthier options available. Here's what to keep in mind when stocking your pantry.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Fruits and Veggies
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Canned fruit comes in handy for tossing on salads or as a snack. Choose fruits packed in their own juices, water, or 100% fruit juice. Even light syrup has tons of sugar -- so avoid it. Typically canned veggies contain about 15% of your daily sodium needs. Look for "no salt added" versions, which contain less than 1% of your daily sodium needs. Canned veggies work well in soups, stews, or chili without much fuss -- or just microwave them for a quick side dish.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Beans and Other Legumes
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Beans, peas, and lentils can be a savior on a busy weekday night. Versions come with no added sodium -- just check the labels. Before using, dump your beans in a strainer and rinse them thoroughly. Toss beans into a salad, soup, or mix with rice for a side dish.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Meats and Fish
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>When you think of canned meat, Spam probably comes to mind first. Meat in a can may sound tempting (for ease, if not flavor), but with 33% of your daily sodium intake in a single two-ounce serving, it's best to steer clear. Canned tuna or white meat chicken are better options. Look for chunk light packed in water (not oil). Many other fish products contain the American Heart Association symbol, which makes choosing the healthier versions easier. Canned chicken works well in an easy, mayo-free chicken salad or other wrap fillings.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Other Canned Foods
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Many soups now come in lower sodium options such as Campbell’s, Amy’s, and Healthy Choice. They're not entirely sodium-free -- a serving is still about 20% of your daily need; the regular versions typically contain more than 50%. The Center for Science in the Public Interest lists the healthiest soup choices.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Handle With Care
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Avoid “can-can” deals that sell dented, leaking, rusted or swollen cans. Botulism, a food-borne illness related to canned foods, is deadly. Discard canned products that are foamy or foul-smelling when opened.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Unopened canned products should be stored in a cool, dry place. They can last for up to two years in your pantry unless the "use by" date says sooner. Use a clean and non-rusty can opener and wipe the top of a can before opening. Don't store food in opened cans -- they weren't designed for refrigeration and can cause the food to taste "tinny." Instead, transfer unused contents to a safe storage container and place it immediately in the refrigerator for up to four days.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>The Bottom Line
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Use these products to help make things easier, but don't get too can happy. Beyond sodium, many canned foods also contain preservatives, chemicals, and sometimes added sugar (that dreaded high-fructose corn syrup even). Used in conjunction with fresh meats and produce, select canned food can be part of a healthy and well-balanced diet.
